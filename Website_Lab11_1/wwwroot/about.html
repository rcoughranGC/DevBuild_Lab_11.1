    <div>
        I, Michael Gary Scott, was born on March 15, 1965 in Scranton, Pennsylvania. I was a child star on the show "Fundle Bundle".
        Hired as as a salesman at Dunder Mifflin on May 6, 1992 I proved to be extremely effective, which resulted in being promoted to regional manager.
        I am commonly referred to as "The World's Best Boss" and I have the mug to prove it.
        I enjoy improvised comedy, the internet, and screenwriting.
